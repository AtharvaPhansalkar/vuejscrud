NOTE : PLEASE INSTALL THE FIREBASE PACKAGE THROUGH THE COMMAND : npm install firebase vuefire 


# task

> crud app

For now, I have added the stories and research links for the content in story.txt, It will contain the orignal context and links to verify the same.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install
npm install firebase vuefire

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
